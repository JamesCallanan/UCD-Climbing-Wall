## How to climb

1. Relevant holds are encircled or marked by a line underneath them

2. All problems start two handed on the designated start hold or holds and finish on the designated finish hold or holds.

3. Suggested rules for footholds include

   1. Feet follow hands
   2. Feet follow hands + Moon shaped wall features on the main boulder wall (Please mark wall features like any other hold if in)
   3. Feet follow hands + screw-ons on the barrel (Please encircle all screw ons if in)
   4. Hand holds + foot only holds

4. If you send a climb, please comment your perceived grade on the relevent route photo on GitHub. Should the majority of climbers think the climb was graded wrong, a pull request can be made moving the route photo to a new folder corresponding to the new grade.

## How to contribute

1. Make a copy of the relevant template photo (i.e. 'Barrel Template.jpg' or 'Main Wall Template.jpg')
2. Mark the holds for your route using a photo editing application of your choice.

Remember!

3. Add your climb to the folder corresponding to the grade you are giving your climb. You may need to make a directory if this is the first boulder of that grade.

4. Make a pull request!
   ( Alternatively for those that don't want to learn Git, don't waste your climb! Make an issue with a photo of your route and a suggested grade. You will still need a GitHub account for this, this is easy to create. )

Happy Climbing :)
