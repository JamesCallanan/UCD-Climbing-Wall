# Collection of routes for the UCD Climbing Walls.

## How to climb

1. Relevant holds are encircled or marked by a line underneath them

游릭游릭游릭游릭 Start hand hold(s) = green 游릭游릭游릭游릭
游댮游댮游댮游댮 Topout hold(s) = red 游댮游댮游댮游댮
游댯游댯游댯游댯 Intermediate holds = blue 游댯游댯游댯游댯
游리游리游리游리 Foot only holds = yellow 游리游리游리游리

2. All problems start two handed on the designated start hold or holds and finish on the designated finish hold or holds.

3. Suggested rules for footholds include

   1. Feet follow hands
   2. Feet follow hands + Moon shaped wall features on the main boulder wall (Please mark wall features like any other hold if in)
   3. Feet follow hands + screw-ons on the barrel (Please encircle all screw ons if in)
   4. Hand holds + foot only holds

4. If you send a climb and disagree with the grade given. Feel free to make an issue, reference the climb, the wall it is on and its current grade. If many agree with you the grade may be changed.

## How to contribute

1. Make a copy of the relevant template photo (i.e. 'Barrel Template.jpg' or 'Main Wall Template.jpg')
2. Mark the holds for your route using a photo editing application of your choice.

Remember!

3. Add your climb to the folder corresponding to the grade you are giving your climb. You may need to make a directory if this is the first boulder of that grade.

4. Make a txt file for your climb if you want. This can contain notes about the climb e.g.

"""

        Creator: Janja G

        First Ascent: Janja G

        Grade given: 8b

        Notes:
        You might want a spotter!

"""

5. Feel free to add a video of you/someone sending it! We may need to switch to linked videos if GitHub limit repo size.

6. Make a pull request!
   ( Alternatively for those that don't want to learn Git, don't waste your climb! Make an issue with a photo of your route and a suggested grade. You will still need a GitHub account for this, this is easy to create. )

# Happy Climbing :)
